#RelationCounter for my friends "SOP" 

This is kinda an upgraded and more updated version of my "WordCounter" since this one isn't static, and just need sheet and docs links.

The script takes all the combinations from the excel sheets until it meets an error, then there's no more combinations to get.

After that we check and save each word that matches the words in our combinations, together with their index_number.

Lastly we output the amount of times each combination has two index_number in two different arrays which are within a radius of _1000_.

###The output can be seen in the output.txt file.
