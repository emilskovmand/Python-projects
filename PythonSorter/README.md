This is a short and very useful project, I use this program to sort my downloads on my own computers. Since I'm the type of person that hates choosing the location for new downloaded files.

Put the "PythonSorter" folder inside a directory and all listed files inside our Python script will be sorted into named folders.

**Modules used:**
*os, shutil, string, random, time, termcolor*
