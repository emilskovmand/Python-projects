This is a short and very useful project, I use this program to sort my downloads on my own computers. Since Im the one that hates choosing the location for new downloaded files.

Put the "PythonSorter" folder inside a directory and all listed files inside our Python script will be sorted into named folders.

**Modules used:**
*os, shutil, string, random, time, termcolor*
