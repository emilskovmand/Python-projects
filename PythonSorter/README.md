# PythonSorter

This is a short and very useful project, I use this program to sort my downloads on my own computers. Since I'm the type of person that hates choosing the location for new downloaded files.

Put the "PythonSorter" folder inside a directory and all listed files inside our Python script will be sorted into named folders.

**Modules used:**
*os, shutil, string, random, time, termcolor*


### Making it run

I recommend making a batch file to make the python directory run, just dump your batch into the desired directory and run it. That should be it.

```call & C:/Users/emils/Anaconda3/python.exe c:/Users/emils/Desktop/Fedt/PythonSorter/main.py
echo "Finished"
```
